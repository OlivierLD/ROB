# Several navigation documents
Those documents can be produced by the code available in this repo.  
Look in `AlmanacRelatedTools` and `Swing.ChartComponents` to have an idea.

To merge pdf files, I use <https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html>,
or <https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf> or whatever lets you do it.

The documents are also available from <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1OXF1qWHj9mNkpVOWxDcnRkQkk?ths=true&resourcekey=0-Bm6JVifnPGfRdnrO4zqGTg>
