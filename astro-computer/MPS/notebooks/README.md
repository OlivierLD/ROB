# Jupyter Notebooks

Start the Jupyter server:
```
$ cd notebooks
$ jupyter notebook
```
If you are running from a Graphical Desktop, the last command will open your default browser.

To use the jar generated by the build, the first code line of your notebooks should be like
```
%classpath add jar "../build/libs/MPS-1.0-all.jar"
```
