# Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks exist for pretty much all the languages having a REPL (Read Execute Print Loop).  
Among them:
- Python
- Java (9+)
- Scala
- Groovy
- Go
- NodeJS (ES6)

This folder contains notebooks for Python, Java, ... more to come.

There are some samples showing the way to use the AstroComputer code(s) fro several languages.  
There is also a notebook (`ZandHeByHand.ipynb`) showing the steps to go through to use logarithms and trigonometry to calculate Estimated Altitude and Azimuth, to come up with a Line of Positions.
