# NMEA Parser, in Java
Includes String Parsers and String Builders.  
Also started on AIS sentences (Work in Progress).

Used by other modules of this project, can be used separately.

Look into the `test` folder to see how it works, and there is also some Jupyter Notebooks to illustrate the topic.

The Javadoc of the `StringParsers` is worth a look.
