# [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

To install Jupyter Notebook on your machine, see [here](https://jupyter.org/install).  
We will be using here some Jupyter Notebooks for Java.  
See [Spencer Park / IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) to learn how to install and run it.

The notebooks will require the jar-file generated by the build of this module.  
From the root of this module (`NMEA-Parser`), make sure you've run:
```
$ ../../gradlew build
```
To make sure Jupyter is available:
```
$ jupyter --version
```
or
```
$ jupyter notebook --version
```

If no insult comes out, you're good.  
Still, make sure you have installed [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava).

To start the Jupyter server:
```
$ cd notebooks
$ jupyter notebook
```
If you are running from a Graphical Desktop, the last command will open your default browser.

To use the jar generated by the build, the first code line of your notebooks should be like 
```
%classpath add jar "../build/libs/NMEA-Parser-1.0.jar"
```
