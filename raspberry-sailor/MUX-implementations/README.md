Projects in this folder intend to show how to implement - and deliver - NMEA-multiplexer instances, with different features, like
- minimal logger, admin and Web-UI
- full server, with REST Implementation, almanac for tides and celestial publications, Web interface for NMEA Data visualization, admin, logging, etc.
