# NMEA-Multiplexer implementations

Projects in this folder intend to show how to implement - and deliver - NMEA-multiplexer instances, with different features, like
- minimal logger, admin and Web-UI
- full server, with REST Implementation, almanac for tides and celestial publications, Web interface for NMEA Data visualization, admin, logging, etc.
- etc

The `RESTNavServer` shows many possibilities, it is more like a demo bunch.  
The `NMEA-multiplexer-basic` shows how to package for production (without a clone of the repo).

Etc, etc.

## TODO
- Proximity threats callbacks. See `nmea.computers.BufferedCollisionCallback` et ses voisins.
