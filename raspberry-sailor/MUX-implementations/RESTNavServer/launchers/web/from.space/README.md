# FromSpace
WiP. Will need refactoring.

Entry point is `FromSpace.html`.

Used with a RESTNavServer, to display the celestial configuration at the GPS time and
position returned by the server.

For an example, try the option `13e` in the `demoLauncher.sh`, and use the
<http://localhost:9999/web/index.2.html> menu.
