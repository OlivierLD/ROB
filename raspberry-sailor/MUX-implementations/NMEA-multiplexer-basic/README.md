# NMEA-multiplexer's Web Implementation Basics (and beyond)
This module is one illustration of what can be done from  Web and/or REST client, on top of the `NMEA-multiplexer`.  
This includes the way to start the Multiplexer (through its configuration file), and the way to reach the data to 
display on a web page.

This module does _**NOT**_ extend any Java class of the NMEA-multiplexer, and as you can see, there is just _**NO**_ extra Java code in this module. There is not even a `src` directory in this module.

The NMEA-multiplexer runs on its machine, and managed data can be access through several Web Interfaces, reachable from any device
with a browser, connected on the same network. This network does not need to have Internet access,
it can be emitted by a Raspberry Pi (like the one the NMEA-multiplexer runs on).

> _**Important Note**_: Some Python resources can be used.  
> Do make sure they are copied from their point-of-truth folders.  
> That is:
> - For parser related features: `NMEA-Multiplexer` module.
> - For sensors and actuators related features: `RaspberryPythonServers` module.

## Basics
It obviously requires the NMEA-multiplexer to be running.  
Data are fetched from the `NMEA Data Cache` using REST Requests.
> For an HTTP server to be instantiated when the Multiplexer starts, you 
> have to set (in the mux's config file)  the property `with.http.server` to `true`.  
> **In _addition_**, for the Data Cache to be available, populated, and reachable, 
> you need to set the property `init.cache` to `true`.

### Get Started, now!
Build, run, watch:
- `../../../gradlew shadowJar`
- `./mux.sh nmea.mux.replay.big.log.yaml`
- then reach <http://localhost:8080/web/basic.html> in your browser.
- and also <http://localhost:8080/web/index.html>, and <http://localhost:8080/web/admin.html>.

> Notice the config file `nmea.mux.replay.big.log.yaml`, look into it.

Also try (this is for lazy-dummies)
```
$ ./mux.sh --interactive-config
```
This previous one was developed for tests, it is a work in progress, it requires some polishing, several values are hard-coded..., 
as you would see in the code (`GenericNMEAMultiplexer.interactiveConfig()`). 

## How it works (in short)
As it depends on the `http-tiny-server` module, the `NMEA-multiplexer` can also act as an HTTP Server (not only WebServer). When the configuration property `with.http.server` is set to `true`, the multiplexer can also serve:
- static Web pages
    - See the system properties `static.docs` and `static.zip.docs` (and its associated `web.archive`).
- REST requests
    - Look into the class `nmea.mux.RESTImplementation`, in the `NMEA-multiplexer` module itself.

> _**Note**_: _Any_ REST client can reach the features available in the `NMEA-multiplexer` (or the classes extending it).
> Web pages can do it - obviously - but also utilities like `curl`, `wget`, and devices like Arduino, ESP32 & friends, M5 sticks, etc.  
> Examples will be linked from here (soon).

## About NMEA-multiplexer's REST operations
As you would see in `nmea.mux.RESTImplementation` where all operations are defined, there is a `/mux/oplist` resource, that will list
all its siblings (and child services):
```text
$ curl -X GET http://192.168.1.102:8080/mux/oplist
```

# Other samples
Many other Web UI examples are available. Just look.  
You will see that some examples need an Internet connection (for Google Maps and Leaflets), some others can run without Internet.  
Some are using WebComponents, some vanilla JavaScript components (directly drawing on HTML5 canvases).  
Your imagination is the limit, use it!  
There is also a [USE_CASES](./USE_CASES.md) document.  
> The WebComponents presented here live in their own repo, at <https://github.com/OlivierLD/WebComponents>. 
> They can be seen live at <https://olivierld.github.io/webcomponents/gallery.html> (it's a biiiiig file).

Examples of Web Admin features will also be presented (in other modules, like [RESTNavServer](../RESTNavServer/README.md)).

# Build and package for production
See the script `to.prod.sh`. It will generate an archive that can be deployed on
a target machine, un-archived, and run.  
To run it:
```
$ ./to.prod.sh
```

Explanations on how to deploy the generated archive are given interactively by the script.  
‚ö†Ô∏è _**DO READ THEM !!!**_ ‚ö†Ô∏è   
And _do not hesitate_ to mess with the code !! ü™†

You will notice that this archive will zip all the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/etc resources into a zip file that will be used
at runtime when a Web Interface is required. The `http-tiny-server` can get the resources it needs from a zip, to minimize its footprint.  
In the production environment, what used to be reached from a URL like <http://localhost:8080/web/index.html> should now be <http://localhost:8080/zip/index.html>.
The http port is assigned in the config yaml file used start the multiplexer.

> _**Note**_: This `to.prod.sh` script takes care of the deployment of the Java and Web parts (http server).  
> If your config requires some sensor data to be reached, the corresponding Python
> scripts should be available on your production machine too.  
> See how to do this is [their folder's README.md](../../RaspberryPythonServers/README.md#tcp).

Here is an example of the execution of the `to.prod.sh` script.  
Notice below when the script prompts the user for his input:
- to rebuild the jar file (based on the current sources)
- for the name of the archive to generate (`nmea-dist` here)
- to include Python scripts in the archive
- to drop the directory the archive has been done from

_Example:_
```
 $ ./to.prod.sh

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This is an EXAMPLE showing how to generate a 'production' version, without having the full github  |
| repo on the destination machine. We will deploy only what is needed to run the NMEA Multiplexer,   |
| possibly with several configurations - and its web clients.                                        |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 $ 
```

The script above is generating an archive named `nmea-dist.tar.gz`, its name comes from user's input.  
Once the script is completed, transfer the archive on your target machine (using `scp` for example), un-archive it (as shown above, with a `tar -xzvf`), and you are good to go.

If an _update_ is necessary, it is even easier.  
Just run the script `to.prod.sh` again, and _**do not drop**_ the directory at the end.  
The structure of the `nmea-dist` folder (or whatever _**you**_ named it) looks like this:
```
$ tree nmea-dist
nmea-dist
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ais.mgr.properties
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libs
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NMEA-multiplexer-basic-1.0-all.jar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kill.all.sample.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ markers.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mux.sh

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REST.ssd1306.dg.properties
. . .
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web.zip

2 directories, 17 files
```
This is also the structure generated on the target machine, strictly identical.  
All you need to do this  time is to transfer the jar `NMEA-multiplexer-basic-1.0-all.jar` where it already exists, and - if needed - 
the `web.zip`.

### JDK Versions
You need to make sure that the version you use to package the soft is compatible
with the machine you plan to deploy it on.  
For example, some Raspberry Pi Zero would not support JDK 11. 

#### Switch JDK on Mac:
```
$ /usr/libexec/java_home -V
