# A System REST Server. WiP.

This is an HTTP Server to execute system commands through REST requests, and that is unusual.  
Be careful.

- The shutdown (`init 0`) seems not to work... Fixed!
---
To be started in `/etc/rc.local` as well.

## TODO
- The same, in Python (see `Java-TCP-Python/src/main/python/REST_server_skeleton.py`)...  
- Integrate in the `to.prod.sh` script.
