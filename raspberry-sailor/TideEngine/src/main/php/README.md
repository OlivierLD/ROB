# PHP Tide Computer

Work in progress.  
Here, size does matter.  
`php` array representation of the stations is too big (fails in memory allocation).  
Same when reading the corresponding JSON file.  

Trying `sqlite`... That seems to work. This requires the DB to exist (`sql/tides.db`).

More soon.
