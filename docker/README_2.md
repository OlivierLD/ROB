![Container Ship](./pix/Container_ship.jpg) -->

Good article [here](https://howchoo.com/g/nmrlzmq1ymn/how-to-install-docker-on-your-raspberry-pi).

- First, [get Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) on your system.  
      On a Raspberry Pi, you can also try this:  
      ```
      $ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
      ```
- For a Raspberry Pi, also see [here](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-easy-way-to-set-up-docker-on-a-raspberry-pi-7d24ced073ef),
and [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-on-raspberry-pi).

> #### To install Docker on Raspbian OS
- `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`
- `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`
- `sudo sh get-docker.sh`
- `sudo usermod -aG docker [user_name, like pi]`
- `newgrp docker`

If problem on Buster, see <https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=273388>

Then
> - `docker version`
> - `docker info`

To clean docker's cache (deep cleaning..., be careful):
```
$ docker system prune
```

#### To get started...
After installing Docker, try this:
```
 $ [sudo] docker run hello-world
 $ [sudo] docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello there!
```
This would tell you if your installation was successful.

#### Pre-defined Docker images
This project also provides a script that will build pre-defined Docker images (different OS's, with various features).
Look into the script, the images are defined by the files `*.Dockerfile`.

Just run `image.builder.sh` (may require a `sudo`...):
```
 $ [sudo] ./image.builder.sh

This script takes care of building different `docker` images. `docker` commands can be pretty lengthy..., the script takes care of everything.
Look into the script for details.

#### Let's go

`docker`'s commands are described [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/).

Using `image.builder.sh`, choose option `1`, it takes some time, the server is started by `docker`,
and you can log on to the image if you want (it's not necessary):
```bash
$ docker run -it oliv-nav:latest /bin/bash
#     #
##    #    ##    #    #
# #   #   #  #   #    #
#  #  #  #    #  #    #
#   # #  ######  #    #
#    ##  #    #   #  #

Yeah!

You can also reach [http://localhost:8080/web/index.html](http://localhost:8080/web/index.html) from a browser.

From another shell:
```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES

```


Get the CONTAINER ID like `a335f585deb0`
```bash
$ docker stop a335f585deb0
```

To drop the image:
```bash
$ docker rmi oliv-image
```

The scripts `rm.container.sh` and `rm.images.sh` are here to help...

### Examples

```bash
$ docker build -f webcomponents.Dockerfile -t oliv-image .
$ docker run -p 8081:8080 -it oliv-image /bin/bash
root@7e754f8732a0:/workdir/WebComponents# node server.js
```

Then reach `http://localhost:8081/oliv-components/index.html`

etc, etc...

> _Note_: there is an image published on docker-hub.  
> You can run `docker run olivierlediouris/navserver` from a Raspberry Pi, and you're all set.

### Case Study
- **The case**: You have a `nodejs` project you want to share with others.

The application reads GPS data through a Serial port, and feeds a `WebSocket` server.
The data can then be visualized through a Web interface using Web Component(s).

To enable everything, you need to:
1. Have a Raspberry Pi
1. Flash its SD card and connect it to a network
1. Install the required build tools
1. Install `git`
1. Install `Node.js` and `npm`
1. Clone the _right_ `git` repository, and its _right_ branch
1. Install *_all_* the required `node` modules
1. Drill down into the right directory
1. Start the right `node` server with the right script
1. Access the Raspberry Pi from another machine on the same network, and reach the right HTML page.

This is certainly not difficult, but there are indeed **many** ways to do _several_ mistakes at <u>each step</u>
of the process.

In the list above, `Docker` can take care of the steps `3` to `9`.
It will build the image, and then run it.
The image can also be pushed to a repository, so users would not have to build it.
Just to run it after downloading it.

The only pre-requisite would be to have installed `Docker` on the machine (the Raspberry Pi here),
as explained at the top of this document.

In this case, the full `Docker` image creation (named `oliv-nodepi` below) comes down to one command:
```bash
 $ docker build -f node-pi.Dockerfile -t oliv-nodepi .

```
Once the step above is completed, plug in your GPS, and run (on the Raspberry Pi where `docker` is running, the one where the image built above is available)
```bash
 $ docker run -p 9876:9876 -t -i --privileged -v /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 -d oliv-nodepi:latest
```
Then from a machine seeing the Raspberry Pi on its network (it can be the Raspberry Pi itself),
reach [http://raspi:9876/data/demos/gps.demo.wc.html](http://raspi:9876/data/demos/gps.demo.wc.html) in a browser.

![Running](pix/DockerAtWork.png)

This shows you the position the GPS has computed, and the satellites in sight.

You can also login to the image:
```bash
 $ docker run -it oliv-nodepi:latest /bin/bash

git version 2.1.4
node:v9.11.1
npm:5.6.0
root@b9679d0d65a7:/workdir/node.pi#

```
... and do whatever you like.

The build operation needs to be done only **_once_**. There is no need to do it again as long as no
change in the image is required.

### Stuff...

```bash
 $ CID=$(docker run -d oliv-go:latest)
 $ docker logs $CID
 Hello go world!
 $
```

##### Save, and re-use
Let's say you run a container, you make modifications to the hosted system, you exit, but you want to later on reconnect and find the modifications you did before.

You run a new container:
```
Terminal-1$ docker run --interactive --tty --rm --publish 5901:5901 --publish 8888:8888 --env USER=root --volume tensorflow:/root/workdir/shared oliv-tf-vnc:latest /bin/bash
git version 2.1.4
node:v9.11.1
npm:5.6.0
root@b9679d0d65a7:/workdir/docker#
```
And you make your modifications.

Still connected to the container above (you've not exited), _from another terminal_ (on the machine where `docker` runs):
```
Terminal-2$ docker export --output myarchive.tar [CONTAINER-ID]
```
Then you can exit your docker session above.
```
root@b9679d0d65a7:/workdir/docker# exit
```

To restore your container:
```
Terminal-X$ docker import myarchive.tar restored:new
```

This creates a new docker image, named `restored`, with the label `new`. Then you
```
Terminal-X$ docker run -it --rm -p 5901:5901 -p 8888:8888 -e USER=root -v tensorflow:/root/workdir/shared restored:new /bin/bash
```

The docker image you're now on reflects the changes done before the container was exported.

##### If `Docker.raw` (on Mac OS) becomes too big...
```
 $ docker system prune
```

### Docker reminder
To be able to save the state of a docker container, and then reuse it, you need to do the following:
- Let's say you've run the commands above, to build the APEX instance
- From the host, run a 
```
 $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                  PORTS                                              NAMES
20b372c88eb6        oracle/database:18.4.0-xe   "/bin/sh -c 'exec $O…"   23 hours ago        Up 23 hours (healthy)   0.0.0.0:51521->1521/tcp, 0.0.0.0:55500->5500/tcp   myxedb
 $
```
- Then you can save the container state into a new image
```
 $ docker commit 20b372c88eb6 apex:2020-09-20
```
- You can exit the docker session.
```
[oracle@73018a29f867 /]$ exit
```
- To reuse the image, as it was when archived by the `commit`
```
$ docker run --name myxedb -d -p 51521:1521 -p 55500:5500 -e ORACLE_PWD=mysecurepassword -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=AL32UT apex:2020-09-20
```

- Send a file to a running _container_
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
5ca873ab5074   oliv-devenv-ubuntu:latest   "/bin/bash"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes   0.0.0.0:5901->5901/tcp   adoring_nobel
$ docker cp tides.zip 5ca873ab5074:~/tides.zip
```
> The `docker cp` command can use Container ID, or name.

- Connect to a running docker container
```
$ docker exec -it <container-id> bash
```

- Stop a running container
```
$ docker stop <container-id> 
```

### Docker Registry
At <https://hub.docker.com/>

#### To push an image to Docker Hub
- `docker tag de1ddc31533e olivierlediouris/navserver:latest` (`de1ddc31533e` is the image-id, returned by `docker images`)
- `docker login --username olivierlediouris --password xxxxxx`
- `docker push olivierlediouris/navserver:latest`
 
The local image can then be removed, and it can now be run like
- `docker run olivierlediouris/navserver`

-------------------------------
